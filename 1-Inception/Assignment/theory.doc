1. What is Element?
Ans. Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element describes what you want to see on the screen: const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>; Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.


2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
Ans. A framework can reduce complexity for you, the developer. As discussed, a framework can abstract away logic, behavior, and even architectural patterns. It's especially useful when you begin a new project. A library can help with complexity, but typically focuses on code reuse.


3.What is DOM?
Ans. Dom is stand for Document object model this is structured representation of HTML webpage or application. it represent entire UI of the web application as the Tree data structure. in simple words it is structured representation of HTML elements.


4.What is CDN and why we use it?
Ans. A CDN is a content delivery network. It is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs are used to improve website performance by reducing latency and providing a more reliable connection.


5.Why is react known as react?
Ans. “And it's called React because it reacts. It was developed by Facebook (a site that CONSTANTLY updates their data) to improve the user interface development and more effectively change (REACT to) what the user sees when they're doing things like mouse clicking, submitting and typing.”


6.What is cross-origin in the script tag?
Ans. The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.


7.What is difference between react and reactDOM?
Ans.React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. Think again. As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM.


8.What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Ans. The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds. The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.


9.What are async and defer?
Ans. Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading. In most cases, async is the better option — but there are exceptions.
